      context: "SpaceX was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk with the goal of reducing space transportation costs and enabling the colonization of Mars. The company's first successful orbital launch of its Falcon 1 rocket occurred in 2008. In 2012, SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft became the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to the International Space Station. In 2020, SpaceX successfully launched astronauts to the ISS aboard its Crew Dragon spacecraft, marking the first time a private company had sent humans into orbit."

      context: "Renewable energy sources include solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomass. Solar power works by converting sunlight directly into electricity using photovoltaic panels or by using mirrors to concentrate solar radiation. Wind power captures the natural wind in our atmosphere and converts it into mechanical energy and then electricity. Hydroelectric power uses the flow of water to turn turbines connected to generators. Geothermal energy utilizes heat from the earth's core. Biomass converts organic materials, like wood and agricultural waste, into electricity, heat, or biofuels."
